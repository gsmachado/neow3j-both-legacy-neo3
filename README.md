# neow3j-boilerplate-sdk

This is a boilerplate project setup for Java dApps. It brings the minimum amount of code
to build, sign and send a transaction and to track new blocks on the Neo N3 blockchain.

## Quickstart

[Java 8](https://adoptium.net/) (or higher) is required.  

#### 1. **Clone this git repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neow3j/neow3j-boilerplate-sdk.git
```

#### 2. **Go to the project directory:**

```bash
cd neow3j-boilerplate-sdk
```

#### 3. **Build the project**

```bash
./gradlew build
```

#### 4. **Execute examples**

The provided endpoints in the examples connect to a testnet Neo node. If you want to run a local Neo
network, we recommend using  [*Virtual Studio Code*](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) for trying
these examples. You can then make use of the [*Neo Blockchain
Toolkit*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-blockchain-toolkit)
which gives you the best developer experience with Neo. Checkout their [Quickstart
Guide](https://ngdenterprise.com/neo-tutorials/quickstart1.html) for how
to set it up. 

You can then execute the examples, e.g., via the `Run` buttons above the `main` methods.
